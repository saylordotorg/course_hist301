**Unit 6: Italy and the Roman Republic (509–287 BCE)** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Like the Greeks, the people of the Italian peninsula were influenced by
sustained social, political, and economic interactions between various
regional cultures. Greek settlers had colonized parts of coastal Italy
in the 8<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> centuries BCE. By the
mid-7<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the Etruscan people had established
control over the central-western portion of the Italian peninsula, and
the Latin and Sabine tribes had also established city-states in the same
area. Archaeological evidence indicates that the community of Rome was
established by the Latins around the 8<sup>th</sup> century BCE and was
later conquered by the Etruscans when the Etruscans established their
control over the region in the 7<sup>th</sup> century BCE. Near the end
of the 6<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the Latin people successfully
challenged Etruscan rule and reorganized the Roman city-state as a
republic. In the centuries that followed its foundation, this republic’s
political system evolved under pressure from constant tension between an
entrenched aristocratic elite (the Patricians) and the common people
(the Plebeians), an historical development known to historians as the
Struggle of the Orders. This struggle only ended in 287 BCE when the
Plebeians won the right to make laws binding upon the entire Roman
state. By this time, Rome was dominated by nobility, comprised of
Patricians and a select number of Plebeian families whose members had
held the highest executive office (Consul) and entered into the Roman
Senate. In this unit, you will examine the various cultures that
inhabited the Italian peninsula before the formation of the Roman
Republic, the foundation of the Roman Republic, and the development of
the Roman political system during the Struggle of the Orders (509–287
BCE). *

    the Roman historian Livy (c. 20 BCE) chronicles the successful

    overlords and the first secession of the Plebeians, or common
    people, in 494 BCE when Rome was under threat from surrounding
    warlike tribes. According to Livy, what were the grievances of the
    common people against the Patrician nobility? How was this secession
    crisis resolved? Through these secessions over time during this
    Struggle of the Orders the Plebeians were able to achieve political
    equality with the Patricians.

     Instructions: Read all of Book 6 in Polybius’s *Histories*. The
    Greek historian Polybius (c. 150 BCE) belonged to a prominent family
    that was active in the Achaean League (see subunit 5.3.4). He came
    to Rome as a young hostage and became the friend and associate of a
    number of prominent Romans. In this book, Polybius provides his
    Greek readers with an analysis of the Roman political system, which
    he credits for Rome’s success as a world power. Polybius’s
    description of the Roman political system strongly influenced the
    framers of the United States Constitution.  
        
     Historians have pointed out that Polybius here made no mention of
    the patron-client system, which was an important aspect of the Roman
    political process. Wealthy Romans as patrons provided legal and
    financial aid to their less affluent neighbors, who, as clients, in
    return supported their patron with their votes in the Roman
    assemblies in the election of magistrates or the passage of
    legislation.
