**Unit 1: Bronze Age Civilization in Greece (c. 3000–1100 BCE)** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Complex, agricultural societies emerged in mainland Greece and the
coastlands and islands of the Aegean Sea during the Early Bronze Age
(beginning approximately 3000 BCE). The cultures of the region
eventually developed written languages, monumental architecture, and
distinct styles of artistic expression. Extensive trade networks linked
the peoples of the region. On the island of Crete, the Minoan
civilization built labyrinthine palaces and exerted considerable
political and economic influence over this area. Around 1600 BCE, Minoan
civilization collapsed due, probably, to an invasion by mainland Greek
peoples collectively known as Mycenaean, who incorporated Minoan culture
and technology into their society and flourished until the collapse of
their civilization at the close of the Bronze Age. In this unit, you
will examine the development of these Aegean civilizations during the
Bronze Age. You will also look at Bronze Age art and architecture and
discuss how archaeologists and historians have used this art and
architecture to learn more about the peoples of Greece and the Aegean
region.*

    trade and the extent to which trading altered the kingdom’s
    military, linguistic, and religious composition.

    about the articles you just read:  
        
     Did the *Iliad* record an actual Bronze Age war between Mycenaean
    states and the Anatolian city-state of Troy? How similar were the
    religious beliefs of the Mycenaean and later classical Greeks?
