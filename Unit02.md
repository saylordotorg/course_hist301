**Unit 2: The Greek Dark Ages and the 8th-Century Renaissance (c.
1100–700 BCE)** <span id="2"></span> 
*The end of the Bronze Age witnessed the destruction of the great
Mycenaean palaces and archaeological evidence, and the testimony of
ancient Greek historians indicates that this period was marked by wars
and migrations. In the era that followed, the Greek Dark Ages
(c.1100–800 BCE), literacy disappeared along with the immense palaces,
in which scribes had used the Mycenaean Linear B script for record
keeping. In this period the Greek mainland and the Aegean region were
much less populated than in the preceding Bronze Age, and long distance
trade with the Near East declined considerably. Beginning c. 800 BCE,
Greece experienced a renaissance, or rebirth, of complex culture with
archaeological evidence indicating a large population increase as well
as the revival of monumental architecture and trade with the Near East.
This era most notably experienced the emergence of the* Polis*or Greek
city-state, which would serve as the center for Greek political and
economic life through the classical period. During this renaissance,
literacy also revived with the Greek adoption and adaptation of the
Phoenician alphabet. This new Greek alphabet was employed at this time
to record the epic poetry of Homer and Hesiod, which would shape Greek
culture for centuries. In this unit you will examine the Greek Dark
Ages, this Greek Renaissance, and the epic poetry of Homer and Hesiod.*

     Instructions: Read this article about the Greek Dark Ages, during
    which the Greek world entered a time of decline when important trade
    links were broken and towns and villages were left abandoned.
    Community life appears to have declined to the level of small-scale
    or kinship-based societies. The archaeological evidence for the
    period is sparse and shows no significant works of construction.
    This long period of stagnation finally gave way to an
    8<sup>th</sup>-century Renaissance, or time of recovery, during
    which settlements (which would eventually become thriving cities)
    were established across the Aegean Sea.</span>

     Instructions: Read all of Book 8 in Homer’s *Odyssey* using the
    navigation arrows or sidebar to advance through the pages. The epic
    Homeric poems tell the tale of the Trojan War (*The* *Iliad*) and
    the difficulties suffered by a hero from that struggle when
    attempting to return home (*The Odyssey*). In the course of
    narrating these events, Homer also provides a view of mythology,
    social and political customs, moral codes, and gender roles of
    inestimable value. In *The Odyssey*, the hero Odysseus, after being
    shipwrecked on the island of the Phaeacians on his return home from
    the Trojan War, is entertained by the king of this island, Alcinous.
    The feast and athletic contests described in this book offer an
    idealized portrait of the life of Dark Age Greek aristocrats.
    Homeric epic poetry was performed as entertainment at such feasts as
    the one in this book.

    style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> or “Birth of the Gods,”
