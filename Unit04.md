**Unit 4: The Classical Age (c. 500–350 BCE)** <span id="4"></span> 
*The classical period saw the production of some of the greatest
artistic and literary masterpieces of Western Civilization, featuring
iconic works by sculptors, architects, dramatists, historians, and
philosophers. Athens emerged as the home of many of these intellectual
and artistic achievements. But this same era witnessed frequent wars and
revolutions as the rival city-states, including Athens, struggled with
one another for hegemony while factions did battle within these cities
to establish democratic or oligarchic regimes. The period began with
many Greek city-states joining together under the leadership of Athens
and Sparta to defend themselves from invasion by the Persian Empire
during the Persian Wars (480–479 BCE), a story recounted by the
historian Herodotus. Athens emerged from this war with a powerful navy
which came to dominate the Aegean Sea by the mid-5<sup>th</sup> century
BCE. This new Athenian Empire challenged the traditional hegemony of
Sparta, which soon went to war against Athens. The rivalry between the
two cities culminated in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE), which was
chronicled by the Athenian historian Thucydides. This war ended with the
defeat of Athens and the dissolution of its empire, but the high-handed
actions of Sparta after this victory resulted in decades of war as the
other Greek city-states joined forces to liberate themselves from
Spartan domination. For a brief period (371–362 BCE) another city-state,
Thebes, eclipsed both Athens and Sparta as the hegemonic power in
Greece. By the mid-4<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the Greek city-states
were exhausted from years of constant war, leaving them vulnerable to
aggression from a rising foreign power to the north, Macedon. In this
unit you will study the Persian Wars, the rise of the Athenian Empire,
the Peloponnesian War, the struggle for hegemony in the 4<sup>th</sup>
century BCE, and the artistic and literary achievements of this era.*

    Professor Kagan describes the mechanics of the Delian League and its

    and prestige. According to Professor Kagan, how do the workings of
    Athenian democracy compare to modern American democracy? In the
    second lecture, Professor Kagan continues his discussion of the
    constitution of Athens by focusing on the judicial system. Pay
    special attention to Kagan’s analysis of the role of women in
    Athens. </span>

     Instructions: Watch these two lectures. In the first lecture,
    Professor Kagan focuses on the causes of the Peloponnesian War and
    the possible motivations for Thucydides’s book, *The History of the
    Peloponnesian War*. Professor Kagan parts ways with Thucydides and
    argues that the war was not inevitable and that the Athenians under
    Pericles followed a policy of deterrence that was aimed at peace.
    Was Thucydides being objective or subjective? In the second lecture,
    Professor Kagan examines Pericles as a general. Pay special
    attention to Professor Kagan’s analysis of the Athenian war
    strategy. </span>

    <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Watching the lectures
    and pausing to take notes should take approximately 2 hours and 30
    minutes.</span>

    outbreak of war in 431 BCE. Thucydides was a firsthand witness to
    these events. Historians today debate as to whether the speeches in
    Thucydides are an accurate record of what these historical figures
    said in public or a vehicle for Thucydides to express his own views
    and commentary on these events.</span>

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and listen to this entire
    lecture, which provides valuable insights into the life and thought
    of Plato (431–351 BCE). In addition to offering important
    biographical details about this famous philosopher, Professor
    Adamson introduces us to the questions that preoccupied him and the
    factors that may have led him to present his ideas in the form of
    dialogues. As you will find, the main character of Plato’s dialogues
    was his teacher Socrates. In the final resource of this section, we
    will read Plato’s account of Socrates’s trial (described briefly by
    Dr. Pomeroy above) in the Apology.

     Instructions: Read this entire text, which provides Plato’s account
    of Socrates’s response to his accusers in the days preceding his
    execution. As indicated in the first resource from this subunit,
    Socrates was put on trial in 399 for a number of alleged crimes
    against the Athenian state including “corrupting the young.” After
    hearing the final judgment against him, Socrates is later said by
    Plato to have made a few additional remarks, uttering at one point
    the famous words: “the unexamined life is not worth living.”
    Considering the points made by Socrates in the passages read here,
    how would you interpret the meaning of this statement? </span>
