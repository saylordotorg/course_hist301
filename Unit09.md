**Unit 9: Augustus (31 BCE–14 CE) and the Roman Empire (c. 31 BCE–235
CE)** <span id="9"></span> 
*In the years that followed his victory over his rival Marc Antony in 31
BCE, Octavian Caesar instituted a series of political reforms that
allowed him to hold a number of key republican offices and powers
simultaneously. Octavian, thus, ostensibly restored the Roman Republic
while retaining enough political power through his control of the army
to possess monarchal authority. Through this ruse, Octavian appeased the
traditional Senatorial nobility who bestowed upon Octavian the title of
Augustus. Historians refer to the political system that Octavian
(Augustus) created as the Principate from the title* Princeps Senatus*or
“leader of the Senate,” which was one of the traditional republican
positions that Augustus possessed. Another traditional republican
position,* Imperator, *or “victorious general,” was also reserved for
Augustus as the commander of Rome’s armies and is the origin of the
word* emperor*. Augustus also stabilized the Roman Empire’s frontiers;
distributed land to the proletariat and war veterans through the
establishment of new colonies in Italy, Spain, and Gaul (France); and
created thousands of jobs for the proletariat through an ambitious
building program in Rome. The Principate as a political system and the
policy precedents that Augustus set for future emperors helped promote a
period of internal peace and prosperity in the Roman Empire for two
hundred years, the* Pax Romana *or “Roman Peace.”*  
    
 *The Principate was not without its flaws, however. Augustus set the
precedent of designating a family member to be his successor by insuring
that the Senate granted his heir the same powers as himself. In this
way, there would be a smooth transition upon Augustus’s death. However,
hereditary succession did not always provide a suitable ruler. During
the Principate, there were a number of mentally unfit
emperors *– *Caligula, Nero, Commodus, Elagabulus *– *whose actions
created political instability. Also, under the Principate the unexpected
death of an emperor without designating a successor resulted in civil
wars as rival military commanders did battle with one another to win the
empire for themselves, as was the case following the death of Nero in 68
CE and Pertinax in 192 CE. The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235
CE resulted in a 50-year period of civil war between rival armies that
ended the Principate and the* Pax Romana*. In this unit, you will
examine the political reforms and policies of Augustus, the social and
economic conditions of the Roman Empire in this era, and the weaknesses
of the Principate as a political system, which would be its undoing.*
