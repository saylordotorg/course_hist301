**Unit 3: The Archaic Period: The Rise of the Polis (c.700–500 BCE)**
<span id="3"></span> 
*During the Archaic period, Greece experienced rapid population growth,
and the economy expanded as trade with the Near East and the Western
Mediterranean blossomed. Land-hungry Greeks migrated from the Greek
mainland and islands and coastlands of the Aegean and established
colonies along the Black Sea as well as in North Africa, Southern
France, and especially Italy. Wars for land in Greece between rival
city-states provided an opportunity for successful military leaders to
achieve monarchal power in their cities as tyrants, often with the
political support of the common citizens who comprised the heavy
infantry in these wars and were dissatisfied with the traditional
leadership of the aristocratic elites. Two city-states, Athens and
Sparta, in this period developed two very different and unique political
systems to govern their cities. By 500 BCE, Athens had emerged as a
democracy in which all Athenian-born adult males actively participated
as citizens in the task of running the city, whereas in Sparta,
citizenship was restricted to the members of its elite, highly trained
military force, which had conquered and enslaved Sparta’s neighbors. In
the Archaic period, poetry took a new direction with the lyric poets
whose verses often treated subjects and expressed views that were
unknown in epic poetry, while philosophers by the end of this period
were challenging the world view of the epics of Homer and Hesiod. In
this unit you will be examining the rise of tyrannies, the political
development of Athens and Sparta, and the lyric poets and Pre-Socratic
philosophers.*

     Instructions: Read this collection of poems from the
    6<sup>th</sup>-century lyric poet Sappho. These verses recall many
    of the characters familiar to readers of Greek mythology and the
    Homeric epics, but re-imagine them in new and novel ways. Viewed in
    this light, the fragments of Sappho’s work found here offer a hint
    of both her prodigious talents and the impressive range of ways in
    which Greek literary artists of the Archaic age made use of their
    common cultural inheritance. </span>

    <span
    style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Instructions:
    Listen to this lecture in which Professor Peter Adamson provides us
    with some valuable insights on the interests of pre-Socratic
    philosophers and their attitudes toward the works of Homer. The main
    subject of Professor Adamson’s lecture is the philosopher
    Xenophanes. Although the importance of Homer to Greek culture was
    immense (Professor Adamson calls the poet an essential part of the
    “shared culture which binds together Greek civilization”), critics
    could be found, such as Xenophanes, who rejected the “all too human”
    depiction of the gods displayed in Homer’s works. As Professor
    Adamson suggests, the questions raised by philosophers such as
    Xenophanes also provide an important preview of the ideas that
    interested later generations of Greek thinkers. </span>
