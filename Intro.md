Course Syllabus for "HIST301: Greece, the Roman Republic, and the Roman Empire"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will focus on the history of Greek and Roman civilizations
beginning with the origins of ancient Greek culture in the Aegean Bronze
Age (c. 3000–1100 BCE) through the period of the Roman Empire at the
height of its greatest extent and prosperity (c. 31 BCE–235 CE). We will
focus on the political, economic, and social factors that shaped the
development and maturation of these two influential Mediterranean
civilizations. The course will be structured chronologically. Each unit
will include representative primary source documents that illustrate
important overarching themes, such as the emergence and development of
Greek civilization from the Aegean Bronze Age through the Greek Archaic
period (c.700–500 BCE), the contrast between democratic and oligarchic
forms of government in Greek city-states of the classical era (c.
500–350 BCE), the decline of the Greek city-states, the rise of Macedon
and the spread of Greek culture to the eastern Mediterranean and western
Asia in the Hellenistic period (c. 350–31 BCE), the evolution of the
Roman Republic (c. 508–287 BCE), and the transformation of this Roman
Republic into a vast Roman Empire encompassing all the lands bordering
the Mediterranean Sea (c. 133 BCE–235 CE). By the end of the course, you
will understand how these ancient Mediterranean civilizations developed
and recognize their lasting influences on European culture.

-   compare and contrast the political and social organization of Greek
    city-states in the Archaic and classical periods;

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST301: Greece, the Roman Republic, and the Roman Empire.
General information on the course and its requirements can be found
below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Concepcion
Saenz-Cambra](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorConcepcionSaenzCambra)  
  
 Primary Resources: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Dartmouth College: Jeremy B. Rutter and JoAnn Gonzalez-Major’s
    [Aegean Prehistoric
    Archaeology](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=104) (HTML)
-   YouTube: Yale University: Professor Donald Kagan’s *CLCV 205:
    Introduction to Ancient Greek History*
    [Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FrHGAd_yto&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=SP023BCE5134243987) (HTML)
-   Jona Lendering’s Livius.org: [Articles on Ancient
    History](http://www.livius.org/) (HTML)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials,
including all assessments and discussion forums. Pay special attention
to unit 1 to learn about the background of Greek civilization; this unit
lays the groundwork for understanding the exploratory material presented
in later units. You will also need to complete the final exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all resources in the course.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **191.75
hours.** Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These advisories should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
the time advisories, determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals for yourself. For
example, unit 1 should take you approximately 18.5 hours to complete.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete the
introduction to subunit 1.1 (a total of 5.25 hours) on Monday and
Tuesday nights; subunit 1.2 (a total of 8.25 hours) on Wednesday and
Thursday nights, etc. Much of the reading for this course includes the
works of ancient historians who wrote more in the manner of a novel than
a textbook. Thus, some of you might read these sources more quickly than
the official time advisory.
