**Unit 7: The Expansion of the Roman Republic (c. 509–133 BCE)** <span
id="7"></span> 
*After the Latin people established Rome as a republic in 509 BCE, they
began expanding their control over central and southern Italy in the
5<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> centuries BCE. They subdued the
Etruscans and Samnites and eventually seized control over the remaining
independent Greek city-states in southern Italy at the beginning of the
3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE. One of the unresolved questions for
historians concerns the motives behind Roman expansion. Were the Romans
aggressively seeking to dominate their neighbors, or were their
conquests preemptive strikes to prevent their neighbors from attacking
them? When Rome extended her influence to Sicily in 264 BCE, the
republic started a long, prolonged series of conflicts with Carthage, a
Phoenician colony in North Africa (modern Tunisia), which had its own
interests in Sicily. In three Punic (Phoenician) Wars, the Romans
ultimately defeated the Carthaginians and established Roman dominance
over the Western Mediterranean by 146 BCE. During the second of these
Punic Wars (218–202 BCE) the Antigonid king of Macedon, Philip V, allied
his kingdom with Carthage to counter Roman advances into the Adriatic
Sea, thus instigating a series of four wars between Rome and Macedon,
which resulted in the annexation of Macedon into the Roman Empire by 146
BCE. In 190 BCE a Roman army crushed the forces of the Seleucid king
Antiochus III in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) at the battle of Magnesia in
190 BCE after this king had advanced his forces into Greece. Thus, in
the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE, Rome had defeated the Antigonid and
Seleucid kingdoms and established itself as the hegemonic power in the
entire Mediterranean basin. In this unit, you will examine the history
of Rome’s wars of conquest and analyze how Rome was able to achieve
these victories.*

    chronicles the Second Punic War and describes the great Carthaginian
    general Hannibal, whom he characterizes as a great force in Roman
    history. Polybius also argues that Hannibal’s reputation for cruelty
    was due to the actions of his close associates rather than his own
    desire to punish the Romans. Polybius concludes that it is
    impossible to know Hannibal’s true character, since his legacy has
    been shaped by the conflicting opinions of the Romans and the
    Carthaginians. What factors enabled Hannibal to defeat Roman armies
    repeatedly?</span>

    Italy to defend Carthage when Roman forces under the command of
    Scipio threatened this city. In the ensuing battle, Hannibal lost
    for the first time in his distinguished military career. Note that
    at the conclusion of this battle the Roman Senate was already
    engaged in a diplomatic crisis with the kingdom of Macedon that
    would eventually lead to war (see subunit 7.3.2). What were the
    terms that Rome imposed on Carthage as a result of the peace
    settlement?
