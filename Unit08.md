**Unit 8: The Fall of the Roman Republic (c. 133–31 BCE)** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Roman military expansion in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE upset the
Roman political system and the status and control of the Roman
senatorial nobility, resulting in the collapse of the Republic and its
replacement by a military dictatorship, a historical development known
to ancient historians as the Roman Revolution.* *During the
2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE, long periods of military service overseas
impoverished small Roman landowners. The population of the city of Rome
consequently swelled with landless workers, the* proletariat*, drawn to
the city from the countryside by the inflow of wealth into the city from
Rome’s conquests. Overseas conquests and annexations also provided
opportunities for Romans to acquire fortunes as merchants, bankers, and
tax farmers. These wealthy Romans, or* Equestrians*, soon became
dissatisfied with the monopoly of political power exercised by the
traditional Senatorial nobility. Beginning in 133 BCE two politicians,
the brothers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, reached out to these alienated
constituencies *– *impoverished farmers, the landless proletariat, and
wealthy Equestrians. The assassination of these two brothers by the
Senatorial nobility initiated a century of political violence and civil
war.*  
    
 *The murder of the two brothers divided Rome politically into two
camps, the* Optimates – *conservatives who supported the traditional
Senatorial nobility *– *and* Populares – *revolutionaries who claimed to
champion the common people. In 107 BCE, one of the prominent leaders of
the* Populares, *Gaius Marius, as Consul, for the first time recruited
landless proletariat into his armies because Rome lacked sufficient
numbers of landowners to wage war against King Jugurtha of Numida in
North Africa and later against invading Germanic barbarians, the Cimbri
and Teutones. The effect of this policy was to make Roman soldiers
dependent on their generals to provide them with pay and land in
exchange for military service. Consequently, loyalty to the commanding
general came to replace loyalty to the Roman state in the Roman army. In
88 BCE and again in 83 BCE, the leader of the* Optimates*,* *Lucius
Cornelius Sulla, marched on Rome at the command of a loyal army to
impose his political will on Rome. Sulla restored the Republic, but a
dangerous precedent had been set. In 49 BCE, the leader of the*
Populares*,* *Julius Caesar, marched on Rome, defeated rival generals,
and assumed the dictatorship. His assassination in 44 BCE by*
Optimates*plunged Rome into another civil war, which ended in 31 BCE
with the final victory of Octavian Caesar, Julius Caesar’s adopted son,
over his rivals for military dictatorship. In this unit we will examine
the social and economic crisis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE, the
rise of the* Optimates*and* Populares*, and the civil wars that
destroyed the republic and spawned a military dictatorship.*
