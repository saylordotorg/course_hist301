**Unit 5: The Rise of Macedon and the Hellenistic Period (c. 350–31
BCE)** <span id="5"></span> 
*In the mid-4<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the kingdom of Macedonia emerged
as the most powerful state in the Eastern Mediterranean. Under the
leadership of Philip II, Macedonian forces conquered numerous
city-states in northern mainland Greece and established Macedon as the
hegemonic power in Greece. Following Philip’s assassination in 336 BCE,
his young son Alexander assumed the Macedonian throne and reasserted
Macedonian control over mainland Greece. Once Alexander had secured
control of the Greek city-states through political and military
coercion, he turned his attention to the Persian Empire. In a series of
decisive battles, Alexander’s forces defeated the Persians and extended
Macedonian rule to central Asia and modern day Pakistan. By the time of
his death in 323 BCE, Alexander the Great had created the largest empire
in human history. Following Alexander’s death, his military commanders
waged war against one another over control of his empire. Alexander’s
successors eventually broke up this empire into smaller kingdoms, which
were each ruled by dynasties descended from some of Alexander’s
commanders *– *Antigonus (Macedon and Greece), Ptolemy (Egypt), and
Seleucus (Western and Central Asia). These successor states continued to
exert Greek influence over Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean
through the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE. Egypt was the last of
these kingdoms to fall under Roman rule in 31 BCE. In this unit, you
will learn how Philip and Alexander expanded Macedonian rule and seized
control over a vast empire, examine the successor kingdoms that emerged
following Alexander’s death, and evaluate the interaction and cross
fertilization of Greek culture and the ancient civilizations of Egypt
and Western Asia in the Hellenistic period.*

     Instructions: The preceding resources have touched upon the growing
    role Rome began to play by the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE in
    mainland Greece affairs. However, the power of Rome was first felt
    by the Greek cities of southern Italy, a region otherwise known as
    Magna Graecia. Read this text, which describes one of the more
    famous episodes from this conflict </span>– <span
    style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">the expedition of the Greek
    king Pyrrhus of Epirus to Italy in 280-79 BCE </span>– <span
    style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">from the point of view of
    two Roman historians. You will return to the subject of Magna
    Graecia and the expansion of Rome in the next unit.</span>

     Instructions: Read this text and the embedded links for an
    introduction to Hellenistic art. After reading the text, click on
    “View Slideshow” to see images of Hellenistic art. As noted by the
    author, artists and architects of the Hellenistic era “copied and
    adapted earlier styles,” but “also made great innovations.” What are
    in fact some of the innovations the authors refer to in this
    passage? Please review and compare also the images of the artworks
    found here with the examples of classical era Greek art in subunit
    2.1.4. Are there any particular differences in theme or style
    between these two traditions that stand out in your mind? </span>

**5.4.2 Hellenistic Philosophical Schools: The Epicureans and Stoics**

    Gaps: Professor Peter Adamson’s “Am I Bothered?: Epicurean Ethics”**
    Link: King's College London: History of Philosophy without Any Gaps:
    Professor Peter Adamson’s [“Am I Bothered?: Epicurean
    Ethics”](http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/epicurus-ethics) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Listen to this lecture, which provides an
    introduction to the thought of the Hellenistic age. As indicated
    above, this term is used by scholars to distinguish the political
    and cultural developments of this period from the classical world
    which came before. In this lecture, Professor Adamson provides a
    valuable overview of the ideas and principles espoused by the
    Epicurean philosophers, a school of Hellenistic thought that exerted
    a great influence on contemporary and succeeding generations of
    Greeks and Romans. As you listen to this podcast, give particular
    thought to what Epicurus had in common with his philosophical
    predecessors as well as the ways in which he departed from them.
    What, for example, does Professor Adamson consider to be some of the
    most novel features of Epicurean philosophy?  
        
     Watching the lecture and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

-   **Reading: Ben R. Schneider, Jr.’s The Stoic Legacy to the
    Renaissance: John W. Basore’s translation of Lucius Annasus Seneca’s
    *Moral Essays*: “On Anger”**
    Link: Ben R. Schneider, Jr.’sThe Stoic Legacy to the Renaissance:
    John W. Basore’s translation of Lucius Annasus Seneca’s *Moral
    Essays*: ** [“On
    Anger”](http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_1.html#ANGER1) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read “To Novatus On Anger” Books I, II, and III
    (i.e., read all of Seneca’s discourse on anger). *Moral Essays* was
    composed by the Roman philosopher Seneca (1-65 CE). As indicated
    above, the philosophy of the Hellenistic age had a heavy influence
    on Roman culture. This was particularly true in the case of Stoic
    thought, a school of philosophy that developed alongside the
    Epicurean. Stoic philosophy enjoyed a great following among Roman
    elites and found a particularly famous acolyte in the figure of the
    emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this text from Seneca, you will
    encounter some famous attitudes of the Stoics toward emotion and
    especially anger (described by the author as perhaps the greatest of
    all human vices). Do you detect any similarities between the ideas
    represented here and those found in the survey of Epicurean thought
    above?
